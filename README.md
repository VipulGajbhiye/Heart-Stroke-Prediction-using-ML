# Heart-Stroke-Prediction-using-ML
This project, ‘Heart Stroke Prediction’ is a machine learning based software project to predict whether the person is at risk of getting a heart stroke or not. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due to heart diseases has increased significantly over the past few decades in India.
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. 
Traditionally, they have relied on standard assessments of cholesterol, blood pressure and health conditions such as diabetes to predict whether a patient is likely to suffer a heart attack.
